# First assignment API 
 
 This is a api that calls for two jokes from diffrent apis, one calls for chuck norris jokes the other calls for dad jokes

How to start the app: 
1. Type "npm install" so that you install the nodue models 
2. Either install "npm install nodemon" if you need it (skip this step if you just want to run in) 
3. Type " npm start " to start the app or "nodemon server.js" if you want to do changes to the code and see it live(need to do step 2 first then) 
4. Type in localhost:3000 to see the result.
